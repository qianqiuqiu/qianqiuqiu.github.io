### Hi there, I'm 铅秋 👋

I am currently a Master's student at **Peking University** (Class of 2025), and I obtained my undergraduate degree from **Sichuan University** (Class of 2021).

My research interests include **LLM Agents** and **Digital Circuit Design**.

### What I'm Working On

*   🤖 **LLM Agents**: Building and exploring agent systems (planning, tool-use, memory, evaluation).
*   🔧 **Digital Design**: Working on RTL, Verilog/SystemVerilog, timing, and verification.
